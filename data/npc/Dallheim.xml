        <parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="I'm the guard of this bridge. I defend Rookgaard against the beasts of the wilderness and the dungeons, and even of the stinking sewers." />
        <parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="Hmm, |PLAYERNAME|. I really don't know if you should go into the wilderness without a shield. You should earn some money by hunting rats under the village first until you can afford at least a wooden shield." />

        <parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="You need a stronger weapon than the starter club to kill wolves. Maybe a sabre or a short sword will do." />
        <parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="A bear can easily kill you if you don't pay attention." />
        <parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="Snakes can poison you, too, but their poison is usually not as dangerous as that of poison spiders. Just be careful and kill them fast." />
        <parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="There are two types of spiders on this island normal spiders and poison spiders. As their name says, the latter ones can poison you which will cause a constant loss of your health. Beware of them!" />
